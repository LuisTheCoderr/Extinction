                <h2>Humans</h2>
                <p>Extinction can affect us as humans by a Cascading Effect – when we lose one species, we may lose many others that relied on them. Reducing Pollination – we rely on pollinators for most of our crops. Losing pollinators could lead to less production and ultimately the extinction of plants. Loss of Medicine – many medications come from plants or animals.</p>

                 <p>Extinction can affect the enviroment by humans agonizing depending on healthy ecosystems to purify our environment. Without healthy forests, grasslands, rivers, oceans and other ecosystems, we will not have clean air, water, or land.</p>

                 <h2>Food chain</h2>
                 <p>As species go extinct, they are taken out of the food chain. Animals that ate the newly-extinct species have to find new food sources or starve. This can damage the populations of other plants or animals. Furthermore, if a predator goes extinct, its prey's population can proliferate, unbalancing local ecosystems.</p>
